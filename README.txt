# Corpus Description

PoSTWITA-UD was created by enriching the dataset used for the EVALITA 2016 task of Part-of-Speech tagging of Social Media (see (Bosco et al. 2016)).
The original corpus consists of 6,438 tweets in the development set (114,967 tokens) and 300 tweets in the test set (4,759 tokens), annotated at PoS level only. 
The conversion and syntactic annotation process was carried out through alternating steps of automatic scripting and manual revision, and finally with some out-of-domain parsing experiments.
