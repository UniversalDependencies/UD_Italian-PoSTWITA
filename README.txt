# Corpus Description

PoSTWITA-UD was created by enriching the dataset used for the EVALITA 2016 task of Part-of-Speech tagging of Social Media (see (Bosco et al. 2016)).
The original corpus consists of 6,438 tweets of the development set (114,967 tokens) and 300 tweets of the test set (4,759 tokens), annotated at PoS level only. 
The conversion and syntactic annotation process was carried out through alternating steps of automatic scripting and manual revision, and finally with some out-of-domain parsing experiments. Parsing results also underwent a manual revision by two independent annotators.


## Corpus splitting
The section of PoSTWITA that has been revised so far (approximately the first half of the corpus) has been randomly split as follows:
* it_postwita-ud-train.conllu: 51,642 words (2808 sentences)
* it_postwita-ud-dev.conllu: 6,380 words (350 sentences)
* it_postwita-ud-test.conllu: 6,514 words (352 sentences)


## Basic statistics
Tree count: 3510
Word count: 64536
Token count: 61887
Dep. relations: 53 of which 17 language-specific
POS tags: 16
Category=value feature pairs: 35
