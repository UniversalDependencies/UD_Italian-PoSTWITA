# Summary

PoSTWITA-UD is a collection of Italian tweets annotated in Universal Dependencies that can be exploited for the training of NLP systems to enhance their performance on social media texts.


# Introduction

PoSTWITA-UD has been created by enriching the dataset used for the EVALITA 2016 task of Part-of-Speech tagging of Social Media (see (Bosco et al. 2016)).
The original corpus consists of 6,438 tweets of the development set (114,967 tokens) and 300 tweets of the test set (4,759 tokens), annotated at PoS level only. 
The conversion and syntactic annotation process was carried out through alternating steps of automatic scripting and manual revision, and finally with some out-of-domain parsing experiments. Parsing results also underwent a manual revision by two independent annotators.


# Acknowledgements

The treebank development has also been possible thanks to the contribution of Fabio Tamburini (University of Bologna), who used AnIta for lemmatization and morphological analysis, and of Alberto Lavelli (FBK, Trento) and Alessandro Mazzei (University of Turin),  who worked on the parsing experiments.


# Corpus splitting

The section of PoSTWITA that has been revised so far (approximately the first half of the corpus) has been randomly split as follows:
* it_postwita-ud-train.conllu: 99,441 words (5,368 sentences)
* it_postwita-ud-dev.conllu: 12,335 words (671 sentences)
* it_postwita-ud-test.conllu: 12,668 words (674 sentences)


# Basic statistics

Tree count: 6712
Word count: 124,410
Token count: 119,238
Dep. relations: 55 of which 20 language-specific
POS tags: 16
Category=value feature pairs: 36
